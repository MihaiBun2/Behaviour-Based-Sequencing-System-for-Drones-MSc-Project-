# Behaviour-Based-Sequencing-System-for-Drones-MSc-Project-
A Behaviour-Tree based sequencing system for drones. Made for MSc Project in Aerial Robotics by Mihai Bundoi.

This repository contains a sequencing system for drones that is built using a behaviour tree architecutre via PyTrees. The system is presented in this repository as tested for evaluation in the report made for an MSc in Aerial Robotics project. There are six scenarios using four different maps which can be found in the "maps" folder. The presented code for the scenario is left specifically adapted for each given scenario.
